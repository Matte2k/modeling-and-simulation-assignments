- add a color palet for all the plot
- add plot export
- fix "stabRegion.m"
- fix time cost with an average CPU time [see appendix 1]
- implement in main all the ex. connected with multistep, theta and IEX4
- debug all the entry condition and check of the different function
    left debug flag only on order one of each methods

NOTE!       theta.m IS NOT BI2 required in ex5... is BI1

Review all the "feval" of the different methods
    DONE FOR:   AB, AM, ABM, BDF, iex4, newton, rk, theta

Comment, description and cosmetic of the functions. TO COMPLETE FOR
    - newton {NOT FINISHED OUTPUT DESCRIPTION}


~ appendix 1 ~
Maybe best choiche is to implement it only for high level function as rungeKutta.m, adamsBashforth.m, etc.etc.
Code:
    tic                                      % Starting keeping track of the CPU time
    for j = 1:N
        [t_H1,x_H1] = heun(f,t_max,x0,h_vect(1));
    end 
    CPU_H1 = toc/N;                          % Computing an average CPU time
